# ASTC Convention Companion Mobile Web App

## Synopsis

The ASTC Convention Companion is a mobile web application developed as part of a team project for the 2024 ASTC (Association of Science and Technology Centers) convention in Chicago. This app allows users to search for speakers and sessions at the convention. It features an innovative augmented reality (AR) component, enabling users to view 3D models by hovering over specific markers.

## Technology Utilized

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface
- **AR.js**: Library for implementing augmented reality features
- **three.js**: 3D graphics library for rendering AR models
- **a-frame**: Web framework for building virtual reality experiences

## Features

- üîç Search functionality for convention speakers and sessions
- üì± Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access
- üîÆ Augmented Reality (AR) feature for interactive 3D model viewing
- üé® Modular and maintainable CSS for enhanced UI/UX

## AR Marker

To use the AR feature, point your device's camera at the following marker:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png" alt="AR Marker" width="400"/>

This marker, known as the "Hiro" marker, is a standard pattern recognized by AR.js. When the app detects this marker through your device's camera, it will display the associated 3D model.
